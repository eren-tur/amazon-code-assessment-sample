Given a matrix with r rows and c columns, find the maximum score of a path starting at [0, 0] and ending at [r-1, c-1]. The score of a path is the minimum value in that path. For example, the score of the path 8 → 4 → 5 → 9 is 4.

Don't include the first or final entry. You can only move either down or right at any point in time.
